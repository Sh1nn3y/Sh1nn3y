## ü§ì About Me

Greetings, fellow visitor üëã.

My (internet) name is Shinney, 18 years old. TL;DR - I like computers, a lot... .

Therefore I started pursuing a carrer as an apprentice for system integration in September 2021. 

On this profile you will, for the most part, find scripts written in AHK (AutoHotkey) or PowerShell that I use to help me do my job as an IT administrator and helpdesk operator.

I also started learning Python since I want to create a webbased project for hosting mainly screenshots and videos, as well as automatically embedding these into applications like Discord, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams and many more (see the "immagger-project" repository [currently private]).


## üõ†Ô∏è What I can do
Setting up and administrating all kinds of Windows and Linux Servers as well as deploying these in remote and on-premise environments like VMware vSphere and/or VMware ESXi, Microsoft Azure, Hetzner Cloud and Proxmox (which these last two I use myself),

Controlling access to corporate resources via technologies like Active Directory,

Planning, configuring, managing and securing (phyiscal, scale-out and on-premise storage) backups,

Deploying applications and other software to corporate devices and endpoints via Microsoft's Configuration Manager, formerly called "SCCM - System Center Configuration Manager",

Planning and building "state-of-the-art" data-centers,

Setting up, continuously monitoring plus dynamically adapting networks to business and operational needs, 

Automating repeating tasks via PowerShell and AutoHotkey,

Providing general and advanced support for end users and customers,

Fixing this stupid printer for the 9th time, 

And much more as I will continue to learn!
