# ü§ì About Me

Greetings, fellow visitor üëã.

My (internet) name is Shinney, 18 years old. TL;DR - I like computers, a lot... .

Therefore I started pursuing a carrer as an apprentice for system integration in September 2021. 

On this profile you will, for the most part, find scripts written in AHK (AutoHotkey) or PowerShell that I use to help me do my job as an IT administrator and helpdesk operator.

I also started learning Python since I want to create a webbased project for hosting mainly screenshots and videos, as well as automatically embedding these into applications like Discord, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams and many more (see the "immagger-project" repository [currently private]).


# üõ†Ô∏è Current Skillset:

Setting up and administrating all kinds of Windows and Linux Servers as well as deploying these in remote and/or on-premise virtualization environments like VMware vSphere combined with VMware ESXi, Microsoft Azure, Hetzner Cloud and Proxmox (which these last two I use myself) or oldschool as a physical maschine,

Controlling access to corporate resources via technologies like Active Directory,

Planning, configuring, managing and securing (phyiscal, scale-out and on-premise storage) backups,

Deploying applications, policies and other necessities to corporate devices and endpoints via Microsoft's Configuration Manager, formerly called "SCCM - System Center Configuration Manager",

Planning and building "state-of-the-art" data-centers,

Providing SAN solutions with NetApp File Servers,

Setting up, continuously monitoring plus dynamically adapting network hardware and its configuration to business and operational needs,

Evaluating, managing, migrating and preventing vulnerabilities together with other cyber security risks,

Automating repeating tasks with PowerShell and AutoHotkey,

Documenting,

Providing general and advanced support for end users and customers,

Fixing this stupid printer for the 9th time today, 

And much more as I will continue to learn and improve myself.
